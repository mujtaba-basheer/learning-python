    "The line `print('Logging in ...')` and `print('Incorrect password ...')` are two separate code blocks. These ones happen to be only a single line long, but Python lets you write code blocks consisting of any number of statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "To indicate a block of code in Python, you must indent each line of the block by the same amount. The two blocks of code in our example `if` statement are both indented four spaces, which is a typical amount of indentation for Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most other programming languages, indentation is used only to help make the code look pretty. But in Python, it is required for indicating what block of code a statement belongs to. For instance, the final `print('All done!')` is not indented, and so is not part of the `else` block. Infact, its a part of same block as the first statemet `password = input()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmers familiar with other languages often bristle at the thought that indentation matters. Many programmers like the freedom to format their code in any way they find best. However, Python indentation rules are quite simple, and most programmers already use indentation to make their code readable. Python simply takes this idea one step further and gives meaning to the indentation.\n",
